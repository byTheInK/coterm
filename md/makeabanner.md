First get your banner as a txt file. We will show it as pure text. Make sure It is an ascii art.

When you made your banner go to the banner directory and put you text file into there. Now you can launch your terminal and start Coterm. 

When you launched it type 
## getopts banner
this will show you all of the avaible banners.
