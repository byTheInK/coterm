# Make a banner
First get your banner as a txt file. We will show it as pure text. Make sure It is an ascii art. When you made your banner go to the banner directory in `%APPDATA%\coterm\coterm\banner` and put you text file into there. Now you can launch your terminal and start CoTerm. 

When you launched it type `getopts banner`. This will show you all of the banners in the banner directory. If you see your banner, open CoTerm and type settings then go to `General` -> `Banner type` -> `<yourbannername>`. After these step you should be able to use your banner.
